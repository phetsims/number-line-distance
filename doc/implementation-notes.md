TODO implementation overview

Suggestion (from @jbphet, this occurred to me during mid-project code review, see 
https://github.com/phetsims/number-line-distance/issues/9): It would be good to explain that the `PointController`
instances play a big role in each scene and in the Generic screen because there are always two of them, since that's
what make sense when thinking about distance.
