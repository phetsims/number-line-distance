# Number Line: Distance - Model Description

@author Saurabh Totey

## Overview

The main concepts in this simulation are distance and subtraction, which are expressed visually through number lines.
The user controls two 'controllers', that, once attached to the number line, have their distance presented on a number
line. Distances can be presented either in absolute form or directed form. An absolute distance is presented through
shading as just a thick line whereas directed distance is presented through shading as an arrow. Directed distance
refers to the distance of a test value from an anchor value, but what represents the test value and what represents the
anchor can be swapped at the bottom left of the interface.

## The "Distance" Scene

On this scene, the user can place the user and person on the sidewalk, and the distance between them will be represented
on the number line.

## The "Temperature" Scene

On this scene, the user can place thermometers in the play area, and the difference in temperature is represented on the
number line. The right side of the play area represents hot temperatures and the left side accordingly represents cold
temperatures.

## The "Elevation" Scene

On this scene, the user can place the bird and fish in the play area, and the difference in their vertical position is
represented on the number line.

## The "Generic" Screen

On this screen, the user can place generic controllers on the number line and the difference in their position is
represented on the number line. The orientation of the number line (vertical vs. horizontal) can be changed, as can the
number line's range.
